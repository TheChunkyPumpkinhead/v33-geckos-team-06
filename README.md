Gekch.io is an open marketplace for independent digital creators with a focus on independent video games. 
It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created. As a seller you’re in charge of 
how it’s done: you set the price, you run sales, and you design your pages. It’s never necessary to get votes,
likes, or follows to get your content approved, and you can make changes to how you distribute your work as frequently as you like.



To start this app use yarn start.
